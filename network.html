																<p> Here we have an undirected graph with the node size dependent on <b>degree</b>,
																	color dependent on <b>gender</b> and edges between the nodes also dependent on gender.
																	The <b>yellow</b> nodes are the characters that do not have a gender labeled on
																	their fandom wiki, they are also the smallest nodes indicating they are not very connected.
																	We see that our largest nodes are <b>blue</b> and <b>red</b> so it seems that our
																	important characters have a gender on the wiki. Overall we see that there
																	are more blue connections in the whole network, this means there are more connections
																	to the male characters in our network. There seems to be a lot of well connected
																	characters in our network. This indicates that there are more than one main character in
																	the series. Now lets take a closer look at our network by looking at the degree distribution. <br>

																	If you know the show then it is no surprise that Michael is our most connected character! Is there a character that you expected to be here and isnâ€™t?

																<p>Here we have the degree distribution for both in and out degree.
																	We can right away see that this is not a random network which
															 	  usually follows a Poisson distribution. <br>
																	<b>In degree</b><br>
																	Here we have a very skewed distribution to the left
																	where it seems that most characters have degree equal to 1
																	 while very few chracters have high degrees like our top 5
																	 list consisiting on a few of our main characters.<br>
																	 <b>Out degree</b><br>
																	 Similar things can be said about the out degree distribution,
																	 however we do not have close to as high values for our maximum
																	 degrees. It is skewed but much less than our in degree distribution.  <br>

																									<p>  Now let's look at our network distribution compared to a random network. Right away we see the difference between the random network
																										and our network of The Office. Just from this comparison we can say that
																										the network of The Office is not a random network.
																										To confirm this we will look at the power exponent of degree distributions.
								                                    <br>
								                                    We can use the power exponent to determine what type of regime we are in.
																										To do so we fit a powerlaw distirbution to our degree distribution.
																										The results from the powerlaw fit are given in the table.
																										<table>
																										<thead>
																										  <tr>
																										    <th>Distribution</th>
																										    <th>Degree exponent</th>
																										  </tr>
																										</thead>
																										<tbody>
																										  <tr>
																										    <td>Degree</td>
																										    <td>2.1488<br></td>
																										  </tr>
																										  <tr>
																										    <td>In-degree</td>
																										    <td>1.7756</td>
																										  </tr>
																										  <tr>
																										    <td>Out-degree</td>
																										    <td>2.2873</td>
																										  </tr>
																										</tbody>
																										</table>
								                                    <br>
																										We see that the total and out degree distributions are greater than 2, we know
																										that this is a Scale-free
																										regime or Ultra Small World because the degree exponent is 2 < &gamma; < 3.
																										This is what you would expect from a social network.
																										These types of networks have the property that the distances between nodes
																										is small because of hubs that reduce the distances significantly. We also saw
																										this in our visualization: we had quite a lot of hubs that connected our smaller nodes.
																										This is also what we say with our main characters being the most
																										connected character - our hubs, reducing the distances between our network significantly.
																										However our in-degree distribution does not fall into the Ultra small
																										world it falls into the Anomalous Regime &gamma; &le; 2.
																										In this Regime is also where we see scale free network, but here we
																										have that the
																										<a href="http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/4#degree-exponent" target = '_blank'>"number of links connected to the largest hub grows
																										faster than the size of the network"</a>.
																										This can only occur when we have a small network as larger networks cannot work if a hub is expecting more links than available nodes.
																										Since our network is very small it makes sense that it could exist here.
