																<p> Here we have an undirected graph with the node size dependent on degree,
																	color dependent on gender and edges between the nodes also dependent on gender.
																	The yellow nodes are the characters that do not have a gender labeled on
																	their fandom wiki, they are also the smallest nodes indicating they are not very connected.
																	We see that our largest nodes are blue and red so it seems that our
																	important characters have a gender on the wiki. Overall we see that there
																	are more blue connections in the whole network, this means there are more connections
																	to the male characters in our network. There seems to be a lot of well connected
																	characters in our network. This indicates that there are more than one main character in
																	the series. Now lets take a closer look at our network by looking at the degree distribution. <br>

																<p>Here we have the degree distribution for both in and out degree.
																	We can right away see that this is not a random network which
															 	  usually follows a Poisson distribution. <br>
																	<b>In degree</b><br>
																	Here we have a very skewed distribution to the left
																	where it seems that most characters have degree equal to 1
																	 while very few chracters have high degrees like our top 5
																	 list consisiting on a few of our main characters.<br>
																	 <b>Out degree</b><br>
																	 Similar things can be said about the out degree distribtion,
																	 however we do not have close to as high values for our maximum
																	 degrees. It is skewed but much less than our in degree distribution.  <br>

																									<p>  Right away we see the difference between the random network
																										and our network of The Office. Just from this comparison we can say that
																										the network of The Office is not a random network.
																										To confirm this we will look at the power exponent of degree distributions.
								                                    <br>
								                                    We can use the power exponent to determine what type of regime we are in.
																										To do so we fit a powerlaw distirbution to our degree distribution.
																										The results from the powerlaw fit are given in the table.
																										<table>
																										<thead>
																										  <tr>
																										    <th>Distribution</th>
																										    <th>Degree exponent</th>
																										  </tr>
																										</thead>
																										<tbody>
																										  <tr>
																										    <td>Degree</td>
																										    <td>2.1488<br></td>
																										  </tr>
																										  <tr>
																										    <td>In-degree</td>
																										    <td>1.7756</td>
																										  </tr>
																										  <tr>
																										    <td>Out-degree</td>
																										    <td>2.2873</td>
																										  </tr>
																										</tbody>
																										</table>
								                                    <br>
								                                    We see that all of the distribution are greater than 2,
																										looking back at our types of regimes we have that this is a
																										 Scale-free regime or Ultra Small World where the degree exponent
																										 is 2 < &gamma; < 3.
																										 This is what you would expect from a social network.
																										 These type of networks have the property that the distances between node
																										 is small becasue of hubs that reduce the distances significantly.
																										 We also saw this in our visualization we had quite a lot of hubs
																										 that connected our smaller nodes. This is also what we say with
																										 our main characters being the most connected character - our hubs,
																										 reducing the distances between our network significantly.
