											<h2>Finding patterns in our data <h2>
											</header>
												<p>A self organizing map is an unsupervised method that is used for exploratory purposes.
                                                    An opportunity to view a high dimensional data sets in fewer dimensions.
                                                    Type of artificial neural network. Gives a great insight whether the data has any underlying patterns that can be distinguished.
                                                   The map shows different circles, nodes, that note different clusters of data points.
                                                   We hope to see our accident types cluster together. </a> </p>

														<h3>SOM quality</h3>

													<p>A high quality map is when we see very little difference between the nodes,
                                                        the circles on the map. This means that we want to see very little change of
                                                        color between the node. Overall this map is not perfect but also not to bad!
                                                        Let's take a look at the heat map for accident types.
                                                        <br>
                                                        <br>
                                                        <br>

														<h3>SOM heatmap</h3>
													</header>
													<p>Here we see where the different accident types have clustering together.
                                                         We see that there is some difference between the nodes occurring.
                                                         Let's take a look at the data in the nodes here on the right.
                                                          Majority of this map is occupied by one class, and as we know there is a huge class imbalance in this data set so it is
                                                        safe to assume this is accidents with no injuries.</p>

														<h3>SOM node clusters</h3>
													</header>
													<p>Alright! Here we see some clustering, we have no injury accidents occupying most of the nodes in
                                                         teal but the purple points show us serious injuries as well as the yellow points indicating fatalities.
                                                         These data points are clutered like in the heat map where we have the green circles.
                                                        This means that the green circles on the heat map indicate accidents serious and fatal injuries.</p>

								<h2>Motivation</h2>
								<p>We wanted to do a final assignment about something we were both interested in and knew alot about so
									we decided to to an analysis about the hit TV show, the Office. This gave us a lot of data to work with.
									Character pages, to make a network, and quotes and transcripts for text and sentiment analysis.
								  <br>
									<br>
									We were interested to discover something new about the show that may not be clear from watching it.
									Below we will share our findings. Enjoy!
